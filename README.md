# Conway's game of life

This is a quick solution I made to [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Made for self-educational purposes.

## Quick example

First, we can select a starting pattern by clicking the cells. The alive cells are black and the dead cells are white. Then, we can click the next button on the bottom right of the
main window. The next state will be calculated and displayed. At any point, we can modify the pattern by clicking the cells.
